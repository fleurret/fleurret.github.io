<a href="mailto:roseying@umd.edu?subject=Graduate workers need collective bargaining rights&body=Dear Provost Rice,

I was disappointed to learn that graduate workers at Maryland are unable to form a university-recognized union, and that you personally have testified to the Maryland state assembly against union recognition. This is deeply shameful and hypocritical for a university that prides itself on “advancing the public good” and “investing in people and communities.” .

Far from remaining neutral and allowing lawmakers and their constituents to change the law as they see fit, you have taken a public stance that flies in the face of our shared values. Your opposition to this democratic, worker-led process goes against the principles that make me proud to be a part of the Maryland community.

I urge you to recognize the graduate workers’ union, or at the very least, to remain neutral in this process.
